# We have Overcome!
---
Oh Oh Oh

We have overcome, we are full of joy.

We are healed in the love of Christ

You have made us strong, You have brought us near.

Now we’re bound together in your love

Bridge 1:

So we will not fear through the storm and through the flood

By Your Spirit, by Your word we will stand, we will stand (X2)

Chorus 1:

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Your love makes us strong.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, In you we overcome

Though the storm may come, we are not afraid,

for we have the name above all other names

He's our victory, He's our joy and peace.

He's the reason we lay down our lives.

Bridge 2: 

So we will not fear through the storm and through the flood

By Your Spirit, by Your word we will stand, we will stand.

And with a trumpet call You will open up the sky

Come with glory and with might and we will be with the lamb

Chorus 2:

Ha - llelujah, Ha – llelujah, we will be with you

Ha - llelujah, Ha – llelujah, Your love makes us strong. (2x)

End:

Oh Oh Oh… …

Your love has Won. Yes, it makes us strong. In you we overcome.
